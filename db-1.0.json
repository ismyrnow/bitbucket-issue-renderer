The way the feature currently works is it zooms you to the full size of the image. It doesn't zoom in further than that. It works similarly to many shopping websites, where you mouse over a product image and get a detailed view.\n\nIt sounds like you want the ability for users to zoom in beyond 100%, and control how zoomed in they are. The reason we didn't do this right away is because the images will look really grainy, and they won't be seeing any more detail than before, unless we had higher resolution images on the server.\n\nPerhaps we can talk about this at the meeting tomorrow.","created_on":"2013-02-12T21:04:52.503983+00:00","user":"ismyrnow","updated_on":null,"issue":147,"id":3116562},{"content":"Moved to following milestone.","created_on":"2013-02-19T18:14:41.299690+00:00","user":"ismyrnow","updated_on":null,"issue":147,"id":3181445},{"content":"In production.","created_on":"2013-02-26T21:28:29.649395+00:00","user":"ismyrnow","updated_on":null,"issue":147,"id":3250530},{"content":"Functionality is no longer working.","created_on":"2013-03-20T18:27:07.234919+00:00","user":"jroache","updated_on":null,"issue":147,"id":3469899},{"content":null,"created_on":"2013-03-19T18:50:57.549034+00:00","user":"jroache","updated_on":null,"issue":205,"id":3458163},{"content":null,"created_on":"2013-04-01T16:10:52.548038+00:00","user":"jroache","updated_on":null,"issue":228,"id":3582470},{"content":"Completed as requested","created_on":"2013-04-01T16:01:32.778103+00:00","user":"jroache","updated_on":null,"issue":231,"id":3582354},{"content":"resolved","created_on":"2013-04-02T14:21:42.085981+00:00","user":"jroache","updated_on":null,"issue":147,"id":3593211},{"content":null,"created_on":"2013-04-01T16:22:53.466980+00:00","user":"jroache","updated_on":null,"issue":247,"id":3582609},{"content":"Should be 5 dashes","created_on":"2013-03-21T17:11:27.697273+00:00","user":"jroache","updated_on":null,"issue":217,"id":3481418},{"content":null,"created_on":"2013-03-26T13:20:46.076256+00:00","user":"jroache","updated_on":null,"issue":228,"id":3525535},{"content":null,"created_on":"2013-03-26T13:19:35.525691+00:00","user":"jroache","updated_on":null,"issue":231,"id":3525521},{"content":null,"created_on":"2013-03-25T21:11:00.211341+00:00","user":"jroache","updated_on":null,"issue":231,"id":3518285},{"content":null,"created_on":"2013-04-08T19:31:22.068730+00:00","user":"jroache","updated_on":null,"issue":217,"id":3671284},{"content":null,"created_on":"2013-04-08T19:49:16.870268+00:00","user":"jroache","updated_on":null,"issue":249,"id":3671498},{"content":null,"created_on":"2013-04-10T00:50:24.514866+00:00","user":"jroache","updated_on":null,"issue":237,"id":3687749},{"content":"completed as requested","created_on":"2013-04-10T00:40:32.741648+00:00","user":"jroache","updated_on":null,"issue":224,"id":3687696},{"content":null,"created_on":"2013-02-07T22:13:07.309039+00:00","user":"jroache","updated_on":null,"issue":132,"id":3072727},{"content":null,"created_on":"2013-02-08T22:45:21.227132+00:00","user":"jroache","updated_on":null,"issue":144,"id":3082777},{"content":"Does not appear to be working correctly in production. \r\n\r\nWhen i hover over a plan image, it grabs my mouse and allows me to scroll in the direction I move the mouse (a bit awkward), but I can not actually zoom in.
